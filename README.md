Assignment: 09 Node.js -Professional README Generator

I created two Screencastify recordings because there is a time limit of 5 minutes and it took me longer than 5 minutes
to answer all of the questions for the application.  These recordings are stored up on google drive and they are shared and the links to these recordings are listed below.

The file created by the application is called: GENERATED_README.md


### DESIGN INFORMATION:

The inquirer package was used to ask the user questions and to get the response entered in the console.  The file system 
module of NODEJS is used to create the README file by calling the function writeFile.
